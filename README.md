# hello-world
# I am a Ph.D. Linguist who specializes in phonetics and phonology. I have focused mainly on clicks in southern African "Khoisan" languages. I have completed several large technically challenging projects such as the following:
(1) Built custom measures of voice quality, to investigate the acoustical basis of co-occurrence restrictions between consonants and vowels.
(2) Collaborated with a Computer Engineer to develop a novel architecture and method for collecting and analyzing high-frame rate (>100 fps) lingual ultrasound data of speech sounds. I have focused mainly on stop consonants, for which the high frame rates are necessary.
(3) Collaborated with a Programmer to develop a repository of R scripts to analyze high frame rate lingual ultrasound data.
(4) Collaborated with a historical linguist to document and describe a number of under-described southern AFrican click languages (such as N|uu, Mangetti Dune !Xung, Grootfontein !Xung and Ekoka !Xung. 
(5) Currently collaborating with a computational linguist to dectect click consonants from the acoustic signal using a Praat script, and get the click type, vowel context, etc. from an ELAN transcription.
